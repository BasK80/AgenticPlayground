# pick-model — method reference

Everything here is *method* — how to decide. The *facts* it operates on (task
types, exemplars, model costs, hardware tiers, consent state) live in the
data directory (see § Configuration) and must be read live, never recited. If
a number or model name below looks concrete, it's an example from a past run,
not something to trust without re-reading the file. The specification this
implements is
[Task taxonomy and routing policy](../../../.wayfinder/assets/005-taxonomy-and-routing.md) —
this file is the implementation, not a second copy of the spec; read that
asset for the *why* behind anything that looks arbitrary below.

## Configuration

Data directory: `$MODEL_PICKER_DATA_DIR`, falling back to
`/workspace/.model-picker` if unset (this repo's own bind-mount choice, not a
universal default). Three files: `hardware.json`, `models.json`,
`preferences.json`. If `preferences.json` is missing, this is a first run —
create it with the five starting task types from
[the taxonomy asset](../../../.wayfinder/assets/005-taxonomy-and-routing.md),
every default marked `"provenance": "assumed"`, and continue.

## File ownership

- `preferences.json` — **this skill owns it entirely.** Task types, axes,
  exemplars, per-type online/offline defaults, consent records, failure
  counters. `ollama-curate` never reads or writes it.
- `hardware.json` — this skill owns only the `creditAllowance` key. Never
  touch `hardware`/`ollamaEndpoint` — those belong to `ollama-curate`.
- `models.json` — this skill owns every `github-copilot/*` entry and the
  `githubCopilotPricingCorrections` top-level block. It may write *narrow*
  tier corrections into an `ollama/*` entry's `maxFullyResidentContext` after
  reading a real `/api/ps` result post-run, but never re-derives a full
  `fitFormula` from scratch — that's `ollama-curate`'s refresh job.
- **Write convention:** read-modify-write, merge only the keys you own —
  same discipline `llm-switch.sh`'s `_opencode_write_config()` and
  `ollama-curate` already use in this repo. Single-user, sequential-tool-call
  tool; no locking designed for.
- Every written fact gets a `lastConfirmed`/`lastVerified` date and a
  provenance marker where the schema has one — staleness must always be
  visible, never silent (map invariant 7).

## Seat type self-service

If `hardware.json.creditAllowance.seatType` is `null` when the consent gate
first needs a percentage-of-allowance figure, ask directly: "Business (1,900
credits/month) or Enterprise (3,900)?" Cache the answer plus
`monthlyCredits` and today's date under `creditAllowance`, `source: "asked"`.
Never guess it, and don't ask again once cached — re-ask only if Bas says his
seat changed. This is deliberately **not** blocked on
[Establish Bas's seat type and how to read the remaining AI credit
pool](../../../.wayfinder/tickets/015-seat-type-and-credit-balance.md) — that
ticket covers the much harder *remaining balance* question (confirmed
unreachable for a regular member; see its resolution), which this skill does
not need in order to compute "X% of your month."

**Optional, degradable extra:** a per-user AI-credit endpoint
(`GET /users/{username}/settings/billing/ai_credit/usage` on the GHE host)
exists and Bas confirmed he can see his own recent usage via the web UI with
no special role — but this was never wired up or tested against the live
API (see ticket 015's resolution), so treat it as something you *may* add
later (e.g. "you've used ~X credits recently"), not something this skill
needs to function. Skip it if it adds complexity disproportionate to the
payoff.

## Matching a task

**Exemplars first, axis inference as fallback** — because the skill's own
reasoning is not free; it spends tokens in whatever session is active.

1. Compare the task description against each task type's `exemplars` in
   `preferences.json`, textually — cheap, no reasoning required. Take the
   best match if it's a good one.
2. Only when nothing matches well, run full axis inference: reason about the
   five axes below, find the closest existing type, or mint a new one with
   its own exemplars (so it's cheap forever after) and append it to
   `preferences.json`.

**The five axes** — inferred and displayed, never asked:

| Axis | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reasoning depth | trivial / moderate / hard | |
| Agentic depth | none / few / many | tool calls, file edits in a chain |
| Stakes | low / medium / high | how expensive a wrong answer is to *detect and fix* — not the same as reasoning depth |
| Input size | small / medium / large | this *is* the context length; drives both the cloud long-context penalty and local VRAM fit |
| Output size | small / large | output tokens cost 5–12x input — a first-class cost axis |

No latency axis — "I'm waiting on this" isn't derivable from task text; Bas
says "fast" when he means it.

**Print the axis line and matched type before acting.** A wrong exemplar
match is common and *confidently* wrong (a high-stakes rewrite can read like
a routine edit) — visibility before action is the only mitigation. "That's
not `doc-edit`" is the correction, and it only works if the match was shown.

**Spanning tasks** (edits docs *and* refactors code in one go): the **more
demanding type wins**. Under-provisioning costs a retry; over-provisioning
costs credits Bas can see and object to.

**The taxonomy is open.** Never hardcode the five starting types' names or
axis values in reasoning — read them from `preferences.json`. New types are
minted when a real task doesn't fit, not guessed in advance.

## Offline detection

One `curl`, classified by exit code + a header dump — full method and all
five message variants in
[the offline-detection asset](../../../.wayfinder/assets/006-offline-detection.md);
this section is the short form.

- Probe target: the **real API host**, not a generic domain — a generic
  domain can be allowlisted while the real endpoint isn't. Cloud:
  `https://copilot-api.info-support.ghe.com/`. Local:
  `http://host.docker.internal:11434/api/tags` (read the actual resolved
  endpoint from `hardware.json.ollamaEndpoint`, don't hardcode the host).
- **Read the cached verdict first.** `preferences.json.network.{cloud,local}`
  — `{reachable, signal, lastProbed}`. Only probe live if `lastProbed` is
  older than 60 seconds. This satisfies map invariant 6 (no decision
  *requires* a network call).
- Classify by exit code and, for HTTPS targets, the `-D` header dump's
  `X-Squid-Error` value:
  - reached the real remote (any status) → **online**
  - `X-Squid-Error: ERR_FIREWALL_BLOCKED`, or an HTTP body containing
    `FIREWALL: outbound request blocked` → **blocked (allowlist gap)** — the
    one case that must **never** be phrased as offline; its fix (`fw allow`
    from the host) is different in kind
  - a squid stock error template (`ERR_CONNECT_FAIL`, `ERR_DNS_FAIL`, a
    timeout) → **offline** — cannot be distinguished from a stale firewall
    image from inside the container; show the raw signal, don't guess further
  - can't reach `firewall:3128` itself → **network layer unreachable** — a
    container-infra problem, not a routing decision; surface distinctly,
    loudly
- **Branch:** cloud unreachable (blocked or offline) → route locally, cloud
  reachable → route to cloud by default (see § Routing policy). Local *also*
  unreachable when cloud is down → hard stop with a clear error, never
  silently pick a `null` model.
- **Message per verdict** (say plainly, never assert a fix you can't
  confirm):
  1. online → no message, route normally.
  2. blocked → *"`<host>` is not on the container allowlist — falling back to
     local. `curl -s http://firewall:8099` shows recent denials; ask Bas to
     allow it from the host."*
  3. offline → *"Cloud unreachable (signal: `<rc/X-Squid-Error>`) — routing
     locally."* No fix asserted — this skill can't tell bug from genuine
     offline.
  4. network layer unreachable → *"Container network layer unreachable — this
     affects everything, not just this task."*
  5. both down → hard error, not a silent local pick.
- Cache the fresh verdict back to `preferences.json.network` with
  `lastProbed`. Same 60s TTL for a blocked verdict as a reachable one, on
  purpose — a fixed allowlist gap should self-heal within a minute without a
  session restart.

## Routing policy

**Cloud is the default for every task type.** Pick the cheapest cloud model
that will succeed on the matched type's axes. Take the local branch only
when § Offline detection says cloud is unreachable — local is justified by
*offline capability*, not by credits (the credit-cost asset found the
credit lever is *which* cloud model, not local-vs-cloud — routing doc work
locally saves a few credits; routing a refactor to a cheaper cloud model
saves dozens).

**Online model choice:** among models whose declared capabilities cover the
matched type's axes (tool-calling for any agentic depth above `none`,
sufficient context for the input size), pick the cheapest by
`costPerMTokUSD` — resolved through § Cost computation below, never the raw
field directly.

**Offline model choice:** read the matched type's `defaults.offline.modelKey`
from `preferences.json`. If it's `null`, **say plainly this task type has no
offline coverage** — do not silently degrade to a worse-fitting model that
happens to be installed. `ollama-curate` owns which models exist and their
tiers; this skill only reads that data, it doesn't re-derive VRAM fit.

**Set `num_ctx` per request, never rely on ollama's default.** Ollama
defaults context length **from VRAM** (`<24 GiB usable → 4096`), so every
local call is silently capped at 4k unless `num_ctx` is set explicitly to
input + expected output tokens for *this* task (ticket 016's finding — kept
regardless of that ticket's KV-cache decision).

## Cost computation

**Enforced code path, not a convention:** when a `models.json` model entry
has a non-null `costOverride`, use `costOverride.effectiveCostPerMTokUSD` —
never the raw `costPerMTokUSD` sibling field. The raw field is known-wrong
for at least the `-fast` variants; reading it directly is a bug, not a
simplification.

**Before trusting a model's plain `costPerMTokUSD`, apply
`githubCopilotPricingCorrections` (top-level block in `models.json`) if this
model wasn't already cached with a `costOverride`/`longContextTier` reflecting
it:**

1. **Fast variants** — if the model id ends in `-fast`, its real cost is 2x
   the non-fast counterpart's, per `fastVariantMultiplier`. One of the three
   currently known (`claude-opus-4.8-fast`) has this individually documented;
   the other two (`-4.6-fast`, `-4.7-fast`) are overridden **by analogy
   only** — keep whatever provenance marker distinguishes that (this skill
   should preserve `"assumed"` there, never silently upgrade it to
   `"measured"`).
2. **Long-context tier** — if the model id is a key in
   `longContextTier.modelsWithTier`, and the task's input-token estimate
   exceeds the listed threshold, double both input and output cost for this
   estimate. Every other entitled model has no long-context tier at all —
   don't invent one.
3. **Data-residency surcharge** — genuinely unresolved whether it applies to
   Bas (see `dataResidencySurcharge.activeForBas: "unknown"`). Don't bake in
   the +10%; if you want to convey the uncertainty, say the estimate carries
   roughly a ±10% band, don't present a single number as more precise than
   it is.

**Estimate tokens** from the matched type's `inputSize`/`outputSize` axis
values (map them to rough token counts consistent with how the type was
scoped — e.g. "large" input for `doc-review` means the actual files in
scope, not a fixed constant) — the point is a number good enough to rank
models and size the consent gate, not a byte-exact prediction.

## Consent gate

Protects **credits**, not patience — local is offline-only now, so there's
no "slow local model" case left for a gate to guard against.

- **Per task type, remembered.** The first time a type wants an expensive
  model, ask; cache the yes/no under that type's `consent.expensiveModelApproved`
  and the cost level under `consent.approvedAtCostLevel`. Never ask again for
  that type at or below that level.
- **Express the threshold as a percentage of `creditAllowance.monthlyCredits`**
  ("~13% of your month"), never a raw credit count — raw numbers don't carry
  meaning without the denominator.
- **Inform-only — it never blocks.** State the estimate and proceed; consent
  is about Bas knowing, not gating the call.
- **Re-ask when a new estimate greatly exceeds the consented level** — the
  gap this closes: approving Opus once for a 20-credit `code-agentic` task
  must not silently cover a 250-credit one under the same type/consent pair.
- If `creditAllowance.monthlyCredits` is still `null`, self-serve it first —
  see § Seat type self-service — don't skip the gate for lack of a
  denominator.

## Escalation

**Only on Bas's explicit word. Never automatic.**

- When Bas says a result was inadequate, step up to a better model for that
  type and record the failure against the model that failed
  (`preferences.json`'s per-type `failureCounters`, keyed by model).
- **A pattern of two-to-three failures for the same model shifts that type's
  default floor** — one failure does not. Read the counter, don't guess a
  threshold each time.
- Never infer failure yourself from output length, tone, or a hunch — that's
  exactly the judgment call LLMs are worst at, and it would escalate on fine
  answers and accept bad ones with equal confidence. Bas's word is the only
  trigger.

## Actuation — opencode only

A prose skill cannot address the running opencode server directly by shell
(no discoverable port, no lock file, no `OPENCODE_SERVER_URL`) — but a
**plugin-provided tool** solves this cleanly, because the tool executes
*inside* the opencode process and gets `client`/`sessionID` for free.

**Corrected from the ticket's original plan:** the ticket specified "a
`/pick-model` slash command via `PluginInput`'s `client`/`serverUrl`." Once
the actual SDK types were read (building this skill), that turned out to be
inconsistent — slash-command registration
(`api.command.register`/`api.keymap.registerLayer`) only exists on an
undocumented, separate **TUI plugin** export shape (`TuiPluginApi`), not on
the documented **server plugin** shape that actually carries
`client`/`serverUrl` (`PluginInput`). Rather than ship against an unverified,
undocumented API, actuation is a **plugin tool** instead
(`.opencode/plugin/pick-model.ts`, tool name `pickmodel_switch`) — which
uses only the documented, stable server-plugin surface (`Hooks.tool`, exactly
as shown in `@opencode-ai/plugin`'s own bundled example) and is arguably
better UX besides: no separate manual slash-command step, no stale-file
handoff to get wrong.

1. **This skill (running as the LLM in the opencode session) calls the
   `pickmodel_switch` tool directly**, in the same turn it decides a model —
   `{ providerID, id, variant? }`. No file write, no second round-trip.
2. **The tool validates before switching**, against `GET /api/model` and
   `POST /api/session/{sessionID}/model` — because the switch endpoint
   itself returns success and silently stores a bogus model/provider
   otherwise, per
   [the model-switching asset](../../../.wayfinder/assets/002-opencode-model-switching.md).
   If validation fails, it reports that plainly instead of switching.
   **Implementation note, verified live rather than assumed:** the plugin's
   `client` (`PluginInput.client`) is the v1 SDK client, which has no
   `.model`/`session.switchModel` methods — those only exist on the `/api/*`
   routes. Plain `fetch()` against the server's own `serverUrl` for those
   routes fails every time with a generic connection error, even though the
   identical URL is reachable by `curl` from a shell at the same moment —
   a real self-connection limitation of fetching the plugin's own hosting
   server from inside its own tool execution (an external fetch, e.g. to
   ollama, works fine from the same call). The fix, confirmed working live:
   call through `client._client.get/post({ url, body })` — the generic,
   untyped transport the typed `client.*` methods are themselves built on —
   which reaches `/api/*` routes without that limitation. See the comment
   block at the top of `pick-model.ts` for the full trail.
3. **`sessionID`** comes from the tool's own execution context
   (`ToolContext.sessionID`, provided automatically by opencode) — nothing
   this skill needs to discover or pass in itself.
4. **In Claude Code and Copilot CLI**, no such tool exists and no server is
   addressable at all — print the exact equivalent (e.g. "switch to
   `github-copilot/gpt-5.6-luna`") and say plainly that automatic switching
   isn't available there. The reasoning must stand alone as text (map
   invariant 4) — advice degrades gracefully, actuation is an opencode-only
   bonus.

## Pin the model catalogue

Set `OPENCODE_DISABLE_MODELS_FETCH=1` or pin `OPENCODE_MODELS_PATH` to a
local copy (found in
[the model-switching asset](../../../.wayfinder/assets/002-opencode-model-switching.md))
so that even the *catalogue lookup* never makes a network call — otherwise
map invariant 6 ("no decision requires a network call") would have a leak
one layer below the routing decision itself. This is environment
configuration, not something this skill sets per-call; note it once and move
on if it's not already set.

## Tier-correction write-back

After a local run, read `/api/ps` for `size`/`size_vram` and compare against
the ollama model's cached `maxFullyResidentContext` prediction. If they
disagree, correct that single field with today's date — this is a narrow,
opportunistic fix, not a re-derivation of `fitFormula`/`slopeBytesPerToken`
(that full-formula ownership stays with `ollama-curate`, which also owns the
`ollamaKvCacheAssumptions` fingerprint those formulas depend on).
