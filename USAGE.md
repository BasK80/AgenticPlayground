# Quick Start (≈ 15 min setup)

## Choosing your LLM provider

The dev container supports three ways to run Claude. Pick one before you start:

| Provider | What you need | Setup details |
|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic API key** (direct or via a custom gateway) | An API key (`sk-ant-...`) and optionally a custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | Steps 1–5 below |
| **Azure AI Foundry** | Access to an Azure AI Foundry resource | Steps 1–2 and 4, then see [README — Azure AI Foundry overlay](README.md#azure-ai-foundry-overlay) |
| **Claude subscription (OAuth)** | A Claude.ai subscription | Steps 1–2 and 4, then run `use-anthropic` inside the container |

> **Steps 3 and the firewall-hostname section of step 5 only apply to the Anthropic API key path.** If you are using Azure Foundry or the OAuth subscription flow, skip those parts and follow the README instead.

For the **Anthropic API key** path, you will also need:

- An **API key** (looks like `sk-ant-...`).
- Optionally, a custom **API base URL** (e.g. `https://your-gateway.example.com`) if you route through a gateway.

The dev container blocks all outbound traffic by default and only allows a small list of hostnames. If you use a custom gateway hostname, it must be added to the allowlist — step 5 below.

## 1. Install the prerequisites

### macOS (easiest path: Docker Desktop)

1. Install **Docker Desktop**: <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/> — open it once and wait until the whale icon shows "Docker Desktop is running".
2. Install **VS Code**: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
3. In VS Code, install the **Dev Containers** extension (id: `ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`).
4. Install **git** if you don't have it: `xcode-select --install`.

### Windows + WSL2 + Rancher Desktop

1. Make sure **WSL2** is installed with an Ubuntu distro. In PowerShell (admin): `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`, then reboot if prompted.
2. Install **Rancher Desktop**: <https://rancherdesktop.io/>
   - On first launch, in **Preferences → Container Engine**, select **dockerd (moby)** (not containerd).
   - In **Preferences → WSL → Integrations**, enable the toggle for your Ubuntu distro.
   - Wait until the status bar at the bottom says it's ready.
3. Install **VS Code**: <https://code.visualstudio.com/> — during install, leave "Add to PATH" checked.
4. In VS Code, install these two extensions:
   - **WSL** (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl`)
   - **Dev Containers** (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`)
5. Open your Ubuntu shell (Start menu → "Ubuntu") and verify Docker works inside WSL:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm hello-world
   ```
   You should see a "Hello from Docker!" message.

> **`gh auth login` fails to open a browser?** WSL2's Ubuntu shell has no
> browser registered for `xdg-open`, so `gh auth login` (and other CLI
> device-login flows, e.g. `tools/new-project.sh --lifecycle long`) can't
> auto-open the login page — you'd otherwise have to copy the printed URL
> into a browser by hand every time. Fix it once, on the host:
> ```bash
> sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y wslu
> echo 'export BROWSER=wslview' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
> ```
> `wslu` provides `wslview`, which opens your Windows default browser from
> WSL; most CLIs (including `gh`) check `$BROWSER` before falling back to
> `xdg-open`.

---

## 2. Get the code

**On Windows, the project must live inside the WSL file system, not under `/mnt/c/` or any other Windows-mounted drive.** Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop have severe I/O performance issues and occasional bind-mount failures when the source tree is on a Windows path. Use a directory under your WSL home instead, e.g. `~/projects/`.

Open your **Ubuntu (WSL)** shell (on macOS, open **Terminal**) and unzip or clone into WSL:

```bash
# Option A — clone from git
cd ~
mkdir -p projects && cd projects
git clone <REPO_URL> agentic-devcontainer
cd agentic-devcontainer

# Option B — zip file
# Copy the zip into WSL first (from PowerShell or Explorer → \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\<you>\)
cd ~
mkdir -p projects && cd projects
unzip /path/to/agentic-devcontainer.zip
cd agentic-devcontainer
```

> **Do not place the folder under `/mnt/c/`, `/mnt/d/`, or any Windows-mounted path.** If you accidentally unzipped there, move it: `mv /mnt/c/Users/you/Downloads/agentic-devcontainer ~/projects/`

---

## 3. Export the API key _(API key path only — skip if using Foundry or OAuth)_

In the **same shell** you'll use to launch VS Code:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."                          # your Anthropic API key
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://your-gateway.example.com"   # only needed for a custom gateway
```

Then launch VS Code from that same shell so it inherits the variables:

```bash
code .
```

> **Why from the shell?** Setting them in `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` also works, but you must then fully quit and reopen VS Code so it picks them up.

**Recommended (persistent, survives rebuilds):** instead of exporting in every shell, run the helper once on the host:

```bash
bash tools/setup-host-secrets.sh
```

It prompts for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (and optional `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`), stores them in `~/.devcontainer-secrets` (mode `600`, never committed), and patches `.devcontainer/initialize.sh` to source that file on every container start. After running it, just rebuild the container — no need to keep the variables exported in your launching shell. See [README — store the key on the host with the helper script](README.md#store-the-key-on-the-host-with-the-helper-script).

For other setup methods (including Windows PowerShell), see [README — Anthropic API key](README.md#anthropic-api-key-default-provider).

---

## 4. Open in the dev container

In VS Code:

1. Press **F1** (or `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2. Run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**.
3. First build takes **3–8 minutes** (three images get built). Subsequent starts are seconds.

When the bottom-left of VS Code shows `Dev Container: agentic-agentic-devcontainer`, you're in.

---

## 5. Run Claude (or opencode)

Open a terminal in VS Code (`` Ctrl+` ``) — this terminal is **inside** the container. Then:

```bash
llm-mode      # prints the active provider
claude           # starts Claude Code
opencode         # starts opencode (alternative agentic coding framework)
copilot          # starts the GitHub Copilot CLI (own auth: copilot → /login)
```

Both `claude` and `opencode` share the same provider config — switching with `use-anthropic-key`, `use-foundry`, or `use-anthropic` updates both tools at once. The `copilot` CLI is independent: it authenticates with your GitHub Copilot subscription via `copilot` → `/login` (browser device flow) and ignores the `use-*` switches. See "GitHub Copilot CLI" in [`README.md`](README.md).

If the wrong provider is active, switch it with one of:

```bash
use-anthropic-key   # Anthropic API key (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in the container env)
use-foundry         # Azure AI Foundry (requires az login first — see README)
use-anthropic       # Claude subscription / OAuth login flow
```

> **Restart `claude` after switching.** The `/model` picker is built once, when `claude` starts, from the active provider — it does **not** refresh inside a running session. After a `use-*` switch, exit (`/exit` or Ctrl+C) and relaunch `claude` so it re-derives the available models (e.g. the larger set offered by the OAuth subscription).

> **Your choice persists.** Each `use-*` command records the provider in `~/.llm-provider`. New terminals and container rebuilds re-apply it automatically — so an OAuth switch sticks even though the container keeps `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment. Already-open shells won't pick up the change until reopened.

For **Foundry**: after switching, run `az login` before starting `claude`. Azure tokens expire after ~1 hour of inactivity; re-run `az login` if you see auth errors.

**Custom gateway only:** if your `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points to a hostname not already in the allowlist, add it from your host shell before starting:

```bash
FW="agentic-$(basename "$PWD")-firewall"
docker exec "$FW" fw allow your-gateway.example.com
```

That's it — try a prompt like `list the files in this repo`.

## Adding skills and tools

Once you're up and running you can extend the agents with **skills** and add extra **CLI tools** — in most cases without rebuilding the container.

### Agent Skills (work in `claude`, `opencode`, and `copilot`)

A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file (Markdown with a small YAML frontmatter — `name` and `description`). All three agents in this container discover skills from the **same project-level location**, so one copy serves everyone:

```
/workspace/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
```

- **`claude`** reads `.claude/skills/` natively.
- **`opencode`** reads `.claude/skills/` via its Claude-compat mode (on by default; disabled only if `OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_SKILLS=1`).
- **`copilot`** lists `.claude/skills/` among its project skill locations.

The skill `name` in the frontmatter must be lowercase-kebab-case and match its directory name (opencode enforces this). Add the directory, then start (or restart) the agent — the skill becomes available, and many are invocable as `/<name>`.

> User-level skills also work and **persist across rebuilds**: `~/.claude/skills/` (claude + opencode) or `~/.copilot/skills/` (copilot). Project-level skills in `/workspace/.claude/skills/` are versioned with the repo, which is why the bundled ones below live there.

**A second, symlinked layout.** Some bundled skills instead keep their canonical copy in `/workspace/.agents/skills/<name>/` and are exposed through symlinks:

```
.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md      <- the real file
.claude/skills/<name>       -> ../../.agents/skills/<name>
.opencode/skill/<name>      -> ../../.agents/skills/<name>
```

`copilot` reads `.agents/skills/` natively, so it needs no link. This form exists for skills that ship supporting files (a `REFERENCE.md`, research assets, seed data) and want one unambiguous home rather than a copy per agent. Either layout works — use the simple `.claude/skills/<name>/` one unless you have that need.

**Bundled skills.** This repo ships a set of general-purpose productivity skills. Four (`caveman`, `grill-me`, `handoff`, `write-a-skill`) are from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills); the rest are project-specific:

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `caveman` | Ultra-compressed replies — drops filler, keeps technical accuracy (~75% fewer tokens). |
| `grill-me` | Relentlessly interviews you about a plan/design until every decision is resolved. |
| `handoff` | Compacts the conversation into a handoff doc so another agent can continue. |
| `write-a-skill` | Scaffolds new skills with proper structure and progressive disclosure. |
| `security-test` | Runs an adversarial pentest of the dev-container security perimeter and reports HELD / BYPASS per probe. |
| `pick-model` | Recommends which model to fit the task — cloud by default, local only when the network is genuinely unreachable — and shows its reasoning. In `opencode` it also switches the session model; elsewhere it prints the command. |
| `ollama-curate` | Reports which local ollama models are installed, which run fully on the GPU vs. spill to CPU RAM on your hardware, and what to pull or drop. |

> `pick-model` and `ollama-curate` use the symlinked `.agents/skills/` layout above and talk to **ollama on your host** — see [Local ollama on the host](docs/providers.md#local-ollama-on-the-host). `pick-model`'s actuation plugin (`.opencode/plugin/pick-model.ts`) is opencode-only and needs a one-time `npm install` in `.opencode/`. Both read a gitignored `/workspace/.model-picker/` data directory; seed it on first run with `cp -n .agents/skills/pick-model/seed/*.json .model-picker/` and treat every seeded fact as stale until re-confirmed.

**Where to find more skills:**

- [Anthropic Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — the skill/command format and built-ins.
- Info Support internal catalogue — _ask your team for the current link (internal GitHub / Confluence); fill it in here once known._
- Community collections such as [`mattpocock/skills`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) and the `awesome-claude-code` repositories on GitHub.

> Only add skills from sources you trust — a skill can instruct the agent to run shell commands inside the container.

> **Claude-only custom slash commands.** `claude` also supports single-file slash commands (`/workspace/.claude/commands/<name>.md` or user-level `~/.claude/commands/<name>.md`). These are not read by `copilot` or `opencode` — prefer the `SKILL.md` form above when you want cross-tool behaviour.

### Installing CLI tools at runtime (no rebuild)

Tools that install into your home directory need neither root nor a rebuild:

```sh
npm install -g <tool>     # → ~/.npm-global/bin (already on PATH)
pipx install <tool>       # → ~/.local/bin      (already on PATH)
```

Both **survive container restarts** but are **lost on a full rebuild** — the install targets live in the container layer, not a named volume. The package *caches* (`~/.npm`, `~/.cache/pip`) are volumes, so reinstalling after a rebuild is fast. To make a tool permanent, add it to the Dockerfile instead — see [README — Adding tools to the development container](README.md#adding-tools-to-the-development-container).

### Firewall note

The container blocks outbound traffic by default. The npm and PyPI registries (`registry.npmjs.org`, `pypi.org`, `.pythonhosted.org`) are already on the allowlist, so the commands above work out of the box. If a tool pulls from another host and the install hangs or returns a 403, add that host from your **host** shell:

```bash
FW="agentic-$(basename "$PWD")-firewall"
docker exec "$FW" fw allow <hostname>
```

See [README — Manage the allowlist from the host](README.md#manage-the-allowlist-from-the-host).

---

## Troubleshooting

**"403" or "connection refused" when Claude tries to call the API** _(API key / custom gateway path)_
The gateway hostname isn't in the firewall allowlist. From your **host** shell (not inside the container), in the repo root:

```bash
FW="agentic-$(basename "$PWD")-firewall"
docker exec "$FW" fw blocks                              # see what got blocked
docker exec "$FW" fw allow <hostname>                    # add it; takes effect within ~5 seconds
docker exec "$FW" fw list                                # confirm it's there
```

**`llm-mode` shows the wrong provider** _(API key path)_
Inside the container:
```bash
echo "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:0:10}..."    # should print sk-ant-...
use-anthropic-key                       # rewrite the settings file
```
If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is empty inside the container, the host shell that launched VS Code didn't have it exported. Quit VS Code, redo step 3, and reopen.

**Azure auth errors or `az login` hangs** _(Foundry path)_
See [README — Azure AI Foundry overlay](README.md#azure-ai-foundry-overlay) for the full authentication flow and debug steps.

**Windows: `code .` doesn't open / opens the wrong VS Code**
You're probably running it from PowerShell instead of WSL. Always launch from your **Ubuntu (WSL)** shell so VS Code uses the WSL-side files and Docker socket.

**Windows: `docker` command not found in WSL**
Rancher Desktop's WSL integration is off. Open Rancher Desktop → Preferences → WSL → Integrations → enable your Ubuntu distro, then open a fresh Ubuntu shell.

**Container build fails on `apt-get update`**
Your network blocks Debian mirrors. Retry once; if it persists, contact whoever gave you the repo.

**Container build fails with a certificate error (self-signed cert in the chain)**
Your network sits behind a corporate TLS-inspecting (MITM) proxy, and its root CA isn't trusted by the build yet — `curl`/`npm`/`git` reject the intercepted HTTPS connections. Drop your organization's root CA export — PEM `.crt`/`.pem`, Base64 or DER `.cer`, or PKCS#7 `.p7b`/`.p7c`, whatever format you have — into `.devcontainer/development/certs/` (gitignored — see the README in that directory), then rebuild:

```bash
docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml build development
```

The Dockerfile auto-converts whatever format you dropped in and trusts it (a no-op when the directory is empty), including for Node/npm via `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`.

---

## Cleanup when you're done

From your host shell in the repo root:

```bash
docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

This stops all three containers and removes the named volumes (Claude session state, caches). The images stay cached for next time — remove them with `docker image prune -a` if you want a full reset.
