name: pick-model
description: >
  Recommends which model to use for the task at hand — biased toward cloud by
  default, local only when the network is genuinely unreachable — with the
  reasoning shown, not asserted. In opencode, can also switch the session to
  that model. Portable across opencode, Claude Code, and the GitHub Copilot
  CLI; actuation is opencode-only. Use when you ask "which model should I use
  for this", "am I overspending credits on this task", "switch to a cheaper
  model", or want a routing decision explained before acting on it.

# pick-model

Decides which model fits a task — never by asserting an answer, always by
showing the axes it inferred and the type it matched, so a wrong match is
visible and correctable. The full method (axes, exemplar matching, cost
computation, consent gate, escalation, actuation) is in
[REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) — read it before doing anything nontrivial here.
This file is the checklist.

## Must not

- **Never require the network to reach a routing decision.** Read the cached
  probe verdict in `preferences.json` first; only probe live if it's stale
  (see REFERENCE.md § Offline detection). The model catalogue itself must
  also come from a pinned/cached source, not a live fetch — see REFERENCE.md
  § Pin the model catalogue.
- **Never hardcode a model name, task type, or hardware number in this
  prose.** Every one of those lives in the data directory (see REFERENCE.md
  § Configuration) — read it live. If a type or model looks wrong, the data
  files are what's stale, not this file.
- **Never read `costPerMTokUSD` directly when `costOverride` is present.**
  Always resolve through `costOverride.effectiveCostPerMTokUSD` first — see
  REFERENCE.md § Cost computation. This is an enforced code path, not a
  convention to remember.
- **Never silently treat a firewall allowlist block as "offline."** The two
  look identical from inside a naive probe; REFERENCE.md § Offline detection
  gives the exact signal that tells them apart. Getting this wrong sends Bas
  down the wrong fix (there's nothing to "wait out" on a blocked domain).
- **Never block on consent.** The credit gate informs; it does not gate
  execution. Ask once per type, remember the answer, re-ask only when an
  estimate blows past what was consented to — never make Bas answer to
  proceed at all.
- **Never escalate to a better model automatically.** Only Bas's explicit
  "that wasn't good enough" triggers a step-up — see REFERENCE.md §
  Escalation. Record the failure either way.
- **Never write to `models.json`'s `ollama/*` entries or
  `hardware.json`'s `hardware`/`ollamaEndpoint` keys.** Those belong to
  `ollama-curate`. This skill owns `preferences.json` entirely, plus
  `hardware.json.creditAllowance` and `models.json`'s `github-copilot/*`
  entries and narrow ollama tier corrections (see REFERENCE.md § File
  ownership).

## Checklist

1. **Load state.** Read `hardware.json`, `models.json`, `preferences.json`
   from the data directory (REFERENCE.md § Configuration). If
   `hardware.json.creditAllowance.seatType` is `null` and this is the first
   time a consent-gate decision needs it, ask once ("Business or
   Enterprise?"), cache it, move on — see REFERENCE.md § Seat type
   self-service.
2. **Match the task to a type.** Exemplars first, cheap and textual; only run
   full axis inference when nothing matches well, then mint a new type with
   its own exemplars. See REFERENCE.md § Matching a task.
3. **Print the axis line and matched type before acting.** This is the
   mitigation for a confidently-wrong exemplar match — visibility, not
   certainty.
4. **Check reachability** (cached verdict, live probe only if stale) and
   branch: cloud-default, or local-only-when-offline. See REFERENCE.md §
   Offline detection for the exact signal classification — a firewall block
   is not "offline" and must never be phrased as one.
5. **Pick the model.** Online: cheapest model on the matched type's axes,
   resolving cost through `costOverride` and the `githubCopilotPricingCorrections`
   block when applicable (REFERENCE.md § Cost computation). Offline: the best
   local model that fits, per `models.json`'s ollama tier data — or say
   plainly that this task type has no offline coverage, per its
   `offline.modelKey: null` note, if that's what the data says.
6. **Run the consent gate** if the estimate is expensive relative to the
   cached monthly allowance and this type hasn't already consented at this
   level. Inform, never block. See REFERENCE.md § Consent gate.
7. **Explain the choice** — the reasoning is the product, written so Bas can
   overrule it, not an oracle's verdict.
8. **State provenance** (`assumed` vs `measured`) for the type's default and
   say so plainly.
9. **Actuate — opencode only.** Call the `pickmodel_switch` tool directly
   (provided by `.opencode/plugin/pick-model.ts`) with
   `{providerID, id, variant?}` — no separate manual step, it validates
   against the live catalogue before switching (REFERENCE.md § Actuation).
   In Claude Code and Copilot CLI, no such tool exists — print the exact
   switch command instead and say plainly that switching isn't available
   there.
10. **After a local run**, opportunistically read `/api/ps` and correct the
    tier verdict if it disagrees with the cached prediction — narrow
    corrections only, not a full re-derivation (that's `ollama-curate`'s job).
11. **On explicit failure feedback** ("that wasn't good enough"), record it
    against the matched type's model and escalate for the next call — see
    REFERENCE.md § Escalation. Never infer failure on your own.

## Packaging

Canonical file: this one, at `.agents/skills/pick-model/SKILL.md`. Discovered
via symlinks at `.claude/skills/pick-model` and `.opencode/skill/pick-model`
(both → `../../.agents/skills/pick-model`). Copilot CLI needs no extra step —
it reads `.agents/skills/` natively. The actuation half
(`.opencode/plugin/pick-model.ts`) is opencode-only and auto-discovered, no
config entry needed.
